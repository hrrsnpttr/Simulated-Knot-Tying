            <h2>The Main Idea</h2>
            <img src="SiteAssets/SiteAssetKnotsClean.png" > 
            <p>
                &emsp;For my final project, I simulated a rope that is able to tie itself into different knots.
                By pressing different keys, the rope will be triggered to execute preprogrammed movement
                sequences that tie it into various knots. The knots can then be interacted with as expected
                in a normal physics environment. For this project, I implemented the knots shown above.

            <!-- Construction and Collisions -->
            <h2>Rope Construction and Collision Handling</h2>
            <img src="SiteAssets/SiteAssetCollision.png"> 
            <p>
                &emsp;The rope consists of a line of particles connected by springs, extremely similar to those
                used in A5. The particles are positioned such that they slightly intersect with their
                neighbors in order to minimize areas where the rope might slip through itself.  
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The rope is able to collide both with non-rope particles and with itself. Collisions with
                non-rope particles are handled by each rope particle independently using a technique similar to
                the one implemented in A5. Rope particles collide with each other in the same way, but are 
                programmed to ignore collisions with their neighbors.

            <!-- Rope Movement -->
            <h2>Tying the Knots</h2>
            <img src="SiteAssets/SiteAssetTying.png"> 
            <p>
                &emsp;The knots are actually tied by moving one of the rope's end points while keeping the other end
                point fixed. Because the environment has no gravity force, this is sufficient to create the loops
                and motions necessary to tie knots. The motion of the non-fixed end point is achieved using a keyframing
                process similar to the one implemented in A1. The paths followed to tie each knot were created by placing 
                keyframes to create a path mimicking the motions needed to tie that specific knot. Keyframe positions were 
                estimated based on reference material and perfected through a process of trial and error. Different sets
                of keyframes can be chosen at runtime, allowing the user to pick which knot they would like to tie.

            <!-- Knot Stability -->
            <h2>Knot Stability</h2>
            <img src="SiteAssets/SiteAssetStability.png"> 
            <p>
                &emsp;The knots tied by this simulation are extremely stable. Under most circumstances, the knots behave
                like a static entity and do not move or bounce around. This is due to two key factors: Fine tuning of 
                collisions between rope particles and a pseudo-friction force generated by the rope's bumpy surface.
